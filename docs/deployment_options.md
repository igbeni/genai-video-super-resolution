# AI Model Deployment Options

This document outlines the trade-offs between different deployment options for the AI models used in the video super-resolution pipeline.

## Deployment Options

The video super-resolution pipeline supports two main deployment options for the AI models:

1. **SageMaker Endpoints**: Fully managed deployment using Amazon SageMaker
2. **EC2 with Docker**: Self-managed deployment using EC2 instances with Docker containers

## SageMaker Endpoints

### Advantages

- **Fully managed service**: AWS handles infrastructure management, scaling, and monitoring
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales based on traffic patterns
- **High availability**: Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance
- **Model monitoring**: Built-in monitoring and logging capabilities
- **Simplified deployment**: Streamlined deployment process with minimal configuration
- **Integrated with AWS ecosystem**: Easy integration with other AWS services
- **Security**: Built-in security features and IAM integration

### Disadvantages

- **Cost**: Generally more expensive than self-managed EC2 instances
- **Less flexibility**: Limited customization options compared to self-managed solutions
- **Vendor lock-in**: Tied to AWS ecosystem and SageMaker-specific APIs
- **Cold starts**: Can experience cold starts when scaling up from zero instances

### When to use SageMaker Endpoints

- When you need a fully managed solution with minimal operational overhead
- When you need automatic scaling based on traffic patterns
- When you need high availability and reliability
- When cost is less of a concern than operational simplicity
- When you're already heavily invested in the AWS ecosystem

## EC2 with Docker

### Advantages

- **Cost-effective**: Generally less expensive than SageMaker, especially with Spot Instances
- **Flexibility**: Complete control over the infrastructure and configuration
- **Customization**: Ability to customize the environment and dependencies
- **Portability**: Docker containers can be run on any platform that supports Docker
- **No vendor lock-in**: Not tied to AWS-specific APIs or services
- **Spot Instances**: Can use EC2 Spot Instances for significant cost savings

### Disadvantages

- **Operational overhead**: Requires more management and monitoring
- **Manual scaling**: Auto-scaling requires additional configuration
- **Complexity**: More complex setup and maintenance
- **Reliability**: Less built-in redundancy and fault tolerance
- **Security**: Requires more manual security configuration

### When to use EC2 with Docker

- When cost optimization is a priority
- When you need maximum flexibility and customization
- When you have the expertise to manage and monitor the infrastructure
- When you want to avoid vendor lock-in
- When you're using Spot Instances for cost savings

## Cost Comparison

The cost of each deployment option depends on various factors, including:

- Instance type and size
- Number of instances
- Usage patterns
- Storage requirements
- Network traffic

### SageMaker Endpoint Costs

SageMaker pricing includes:
- Instance costs (higher than equivalent EC2 instances)
- Data processing costs
- Storage costs

For example, a `ml.g4dn.xlarge` instance costs approximately $0.736/hour on SageMaker, compared to $0.526/hour for the equivalent EC2 instance.

### EC2 with Docker Costs

EC2 pricing includes:
- Instance costs
- EBS storage costs
- Data transfer costs

Using Spot Instances can reduce costs by up to 70-90% compared to On-Demand instances.

## Performance Comparison

Both deployment options can provide similar performance when configured correctly. However:

- SageMaker may have slightly higher latency due to the additional abstraction layer
- EC2 with Docker provides more control over performance optimization
- SageMaker handles scaling more efficiently out of the box

## Deployment Scripts

We provide deployment scripts for both options:

- `scripts/deploy_sagemaker_endpoints.sh`: Deploys models to SageMaker endpoints
- `scripts/deploy_ec2_docker.sh`: Deploys models to EC2 instances with Docker

## Recommendation

For this video super-resolution pipeline, we recommend:

- **SageMaker Endpoints** for production environments where reliability, scalability, and ease of management are priorities
- **EC2 with Docker** for development, testing, or cost-sensitive production environments

The best choice depends on your specific requirements, budget, and operational capabilities.

## Hybrid Approach

You can also use a hybrid approach:
- Use SageMaker for production traffic
- Use EC2 with Docker for development and testing
- Use EC2 with Docker for batch processing jobs
- Use SageMaker for real-time inference

This allows you to leverage the advantages of both deployment options while minimizing their disadvantages.
